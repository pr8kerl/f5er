# f5er

An F5 rest client.

Supports nodes, pools, poolmembers, virtuals, nodes, policies, irules, client-ssl profiles and http monitors in full - so far. Some statistics retrieval.

Create, modify and delete F5 objects easily, using json input files.

A convenience entity called a **stack** can be used to act upon nodes, their pool and its virtual server as one.

Supports the REST methods GET (show), POST (create), PUT (update) and DELETE (delete).

Most commands will display the response in json as provided by the F5 device. Please note that although the response json may look similar to input json, some json object fields differ. For example, pool members within a pool are displayed within a membersReference object in a response, however members must be defined as an array within the **members** array in a pool object. Also some json object response fields are read-only and cannot be used with an input object (the object supplied in the body of a POST or PUT operation.

It can now display statistics in graphite format for virtuals, pools, nodes and rules. 
If you are a prometheus user, then also check out [bigip_exporter](https://github.com/ExpressenAB/bigip_exporter).

## Build

Use docker and docker-compose to build.

```
docker-compose run make [linux|windows|darwin]
```

## credentials

**f5er** looks for device credentials in the current environment, or if not found in a config file.

### Environment variables

You can use the following environment variables to specify the F5 device and credentials.
```
F5_DEVICE="192.168.0.100"
F5_USERNAME="admin"
F5_PASSWD="superSecretSquirrel"

export F5_DEVICE F5_USERNAME F5_PASSWD
```

### Config file

F5 ip address/hostname and login credentials can also be stored in a json input file in the current directory.
The expected file is called **f5.json** and it can be in the current working directory or in $HOME/.f5/.
Below is a full example of all current configurables. The **stats_** ones (used for displaying statistics) are only available in a config file.

```
{
  "device": "192.168.0.100",
  "username": "admin",
  "passwd": "superSecretSquirrel",
  "stats_path_prefix": "prd.f5.bigip01",
  "stats_show_zero_values": false
}
```


## help

Use the help command to display hints and available subcommands

```

```

## Device

The following command will display info about the F5 device or cluster. Handy to see which is active/standby.
Only show is supported for device.

```
./f5er show device
[
	{
		"name": "bigip-1.example.com",
		"fullPath": "/Common/bigip-1.example.com",
		"failoverState": "standby",
		"managementIP": "192.168.0.100"
	},
	{
		"name": "bigip-2.example.com",
		"fullPath": "/Common/bigip-2.example.com",
		"failoverState": "active",
		"managementIP": "192.168.0.101"
	}
]
```

## Stacks

This is a convenience construct and does not exist within F5 terminology. 
It effectively allows commands to work on multiple nodes, pools, virtual servers, rules and policies in one operation. It uses a REST transaction to do so.
Look at the file stack.json to see how to structure the input file.
Show, add, update and delete operations are supported.

```
./f5er help add stack
add a new stack

Usage: 
  f5er add stack [flags]

 Available Flags:
  -d, --debug=false: debug output
  -f, --f5="": IP or hostname of F5 to poke
  -h, --help=false: help for stack
  -i, --input="": input json f5 configuration


```

## Pools

Show, add, delete and update a single pool.

### Show pools

Show all pools
```
f5er show pool
```

Display a single pool in detail
```
f5er show pool /partition/poolname
```

### Add a new pool

Provide a json input file with all the new pool configuration information. You can base a new pool on the output from a current pool. 

```
f5er add pool --input=pool.json
```

### Modify an existing pool

You can modify the config of an existing pool, including the pool members.

Again, provide a json input file with the updated configuration

```
f5er update pool --input=pool.json
```


## Pool members

Pool members can be created/modified in a similar way to pools.
When pool members are created/modified, the current pool member info is always overwritten. So any new config needs to provide information for all pool members.

Additionally, pool members can be manually brought online or taken offline.

### Offline a poolmember

Provide the pool name and pool member. The following will manually mark a pool member offline. Active sessions will continue until they naturally end. This allows connection draining.
```
f5er offline poolmember --pool=/partition/poolname /partition/poolmember:portnumber
```

To take a pool member offline immediately, provide the **--now** command line option. This will prevent existing connections from continuing on the pool member.
```
f5er offline poolmember --now --pool=/partition/poolname /partition/poolmember:portnumber
```
### Bring a pool member online

The opposite to the poolmember offline command


## Statistics

Query F5 statistics for LTM virtuals, pools, nodes and rules.
Output is returned in graphite format.
To set a custom graphite path prefix, use a config file and set the configurable **stats_path_prefix**. See the conf file example above.
Only statistics that are non-zero will be returned by default. Override this by setting the configurable **stats_show_zero_values** to true.

To retrieve all stats for a single virtual server...
```
./f5er stats virtual /DMZ/virtual-prd
f5.DMZ.virtual.virtual-prd.fiveMinAvgUsageRatio 0 1465879005
f5.DMZ.virtual.virtual-prd.oneMinAvgUsageRatio 0 1465879005
f5.DMZ.virtual.virtual-prd.clientside.curConns 28 1465879005
...
```

To retrieve stats for all virtual servers in one hit, don't pass a virtual as an argument...
```
./f5er stats virtual
f5.DMZ.virtual.virtualserver.Clientside_bitsIn 160632 1465880938
f5.DMZ.virtual.virtualserver.Clientside_bitsOut 67000 1465880938
f5.DMZ.virtual.virtualserver.Clientside_maxConns 2 1465880938
f5.DMZ.virtual.virtualserver.Clientside_pktsIn 228 1465880938
f5.DMZ.virtual.virtualserver.Clientside_pktsOut 105 1465880938
...

```

#### transaction info


```
POST https://192.168.25.42/mgmt/tm/transaction

{
"transId":1389812351,
"state":"STARTED",
"timeoutSeconds":30,
"kind":"tm:transactionstate",
"selfLink":"https://localhost/mgmt/tm/transaction/1389812351?ver=11.5.0"
}


GET https://192.168.25.42/mgmt/tm/transaction
GET https://192.168.25.42/mgmt/tm/transaction/<transId>


Modifying a transaction
After you create a transaction, you can populate the transaction by adding commands. Individual commands
comprise the operations that a transaction performs. Commands are added in the order they are received
but you can delete commands or change the order of the commands in the transaction.
1. To add a command to a transaction, use the POST method and specify the
X-F5-REST-Coordination-Id HTTP header with the transaction ID value from the example
(1389812351). In the example, the request creates a new pool and adds a single member to the pool.
POST https://192.168.25.42/mgmt/tm/ltm/pool
X-F5-REST-Coordination-Id:1389812351
{
"name":"tcb-xact-pool",
"members": [ {"name":"192.168.25.32:80","description":"First pool for transactions"} ]
}

The response indicates that iControl® REST added the operation to the transaction.
{
"transId":1389812351,
"state":"STARTED",
"timeoutSeconds":30,
"kind":"tm:transactionstate",
"selfLink":"https://localhost/mgmt/tm/transaction/1389813931?ver=11.5.0"
}
