Modifying a transaction
After you create a transaction, you can populate the transaction by adding commands. Individual commands
comprise the operations that a transaction performs. Commands are added in the order they are received
but you can delete commands or change the order of the commands in the transaction.
1. To add a command to a transaction, use the POST method and specify the
X-F5-REST-Coordination-Id HTTP header with the transaction ID value from the example
(1389812351). In the example, the request creates a new pool and adds a single member to the pool.
POST https://192.168.25.42/mgmt/tm/ltm/pool
X-F5-REST-Coordination-Id:1389812351
{
"name":"tcb-xact-pool",
"members": [ {"name":"192.168.25.32:80","description":"First pool for transactions"} ]
}

The response indicates that iControlÂ® REST added the operation to the transaction.
{
"transId":1389812351,
"state":"STARTED",
"timeoutSeconds":30,
"kind":"tm:transactionstate",
"selfLink":"https://localhost/mgmt/tm/transaction/1389813931?ver=11.5.0"
